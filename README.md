# Xmodmap-Czech-QWERTZ-layout
Czech QWERTZ keyboard layout for Xmodmap.

I have tried to reflect most of the keys I could think of, there are possibly some missing, but most of it should be there.

# Usage

Place the **.Xmodmap** file into your **home** directory and run

```
xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap
```
